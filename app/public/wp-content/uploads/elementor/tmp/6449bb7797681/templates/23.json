I am not the customer, it's actually my girlfriend who couldn't leave a 2nd review. The only issue is the time it took to finish. Kaleb came here from the SW side to the near Spring area. He took it upon himself to come here first, so that part, I felt was good cust service. However, the scheduling could've been better. He had to come by, then go get the grill for the vent. I understand why he had to, but he shpudlhave been scheduled for a job on the sw side, then north. The window was 1-4, so traffic got him here at 4:05. Scheduling employees better would get a 5star for sure.
